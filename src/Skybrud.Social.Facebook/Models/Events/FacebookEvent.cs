        // 2014-12-27: The location of an event may be specified as either a string or an already created place.
        // According to the API documentation, the returned "venue" property will be of the type "Place", but the
        // returned data doesn't match a place. If the specified location is a string, the returned object for "venue"
        // will only contain the "name" property. If the location is specified as an already created place, the
        // returned will look similar the "location" property of a page, but also with an "id" property.
        //
        // 2017-01-14: When testing now with v2.8 of the Graph API, the "venue" property seems to have been replaced by
        // a "place" property. The location/place of an event is now returned as an object - even if only
        // the name of the location has specified.

        // 2014-12-27: Even though the Facebook API documenation specifies that an event can have a "cover" property, I
        // haven't been able to find an event where that is the case. I'm not sure whether the property isn't used
        // anymore, or whether it simply depends on the scope (which wouldn't make sense).
        //
        // 2017-01-14: This issue no longer seems to be the case (testing with v2.8).
